# Purpose
The goal of this repository is to help you understand how Bunnyshell should be used, by providing examples for Bunnyshell's Environment definition, the `env.yaml`.

# Approach

Covering stacks is ideal, but due to the infinite possibilities to put an Environment together, we're not going to even try that.

However, we thought of the next best thing - we will present you with:
- as many individual Components as we can, covering a wide range of technology
- as well as some complete Environment definitions for stacks which are common and combine plausible Components together
So you can get an idea about how Bunnyshell works.


# Structure

In the `components` folder you will find sub-folders named after the piece of technology that the Component integrates into Bunnyshell.

In the `stacks` folder you will find sub-folders named by the base programming language, an inside another level of sub-folders, containing complete examples of Environments, named either by their platform / framework / technology stack.

Each Component / Environment definition will explain what is relevant in their own README.md file.

# Requests / Contributions

If you have a Component which doesn't work they way you expect it to, or if you're just having a hard(er) time putting things together in an Environment, **don't hesitate to reach out**.

We're more than happy to help!

Also, feel free to **fork the repository and hit us with a Pull Request**. It's one of the things which will make us genuinely happy.
