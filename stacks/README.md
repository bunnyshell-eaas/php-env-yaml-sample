# Stack Examples

In this section, you will be able to see working examples of applications bundles with components.

The list will not be exhaustive, by no means, but you will definitely get the idea, and more than that - you will have enough examples to easily craft the `env.yaml` for your own stack through composition and adaptation.

# Simplicity as first rule

We've kept the examples for environments as slim as possible with 2-3 components, so they are easy to read and understand.

Obviously, you can combine them in any way and in any numbers to match your stacks.
