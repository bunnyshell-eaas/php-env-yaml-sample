# Trivial applications, same outcome

The applications (if we can call them that) are as simple as they get: their sole purpose is to check connectivity with other services, as lightweight as possible.

You should be able to read and understand the code easily, event if you're not familiar with a certain programming language we used.

Fortunately, containerization abstracts away the complexity and details of the application which needs to be deployed.
So, regardless of what framework / platform you run, and the application's complexity, these very simple apps are just as relevant.
